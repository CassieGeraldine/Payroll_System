Payroll system where we can register all the employees

# Employee Payroll System

Given a few of employee names I want you to create a payroll system where we can register all the employees

Each employee has a name and surname as well as an employee number

1) Tom Baily 00635
2) Edwin Bark 87958
3) Josh Wolf 09783

## NB

I want you to use 3 separate lists, one for the name,. another for the surname and one more for the employee number

## Features

The managements system should have a greeting message and a menu that asks the user to:

1) [View employees](#viewing-employees)
2) [Add an employee](#adding-an-employee)
3) [Delete an employee](#deleting-an-employee)
4) [Update an employee](#updating-an-employee)
5) Quit

### Viewing employees

This should show you all the employees that are currently registered on the system

### Adding an employee

We must be able to add the employee name, surname and employee number

Once we are finished a prompt gets displayed asking you to confirm. If you choose yes, the information gets saved if you choose no we discard the information.

### Deleting an employee

When you choose delete, it should show you all the registered employees in a list format

#### Example

1) Josh Wolf 0000

Then from the list we can choose which employee to delete

### Updating an employee

This should give us the option to update the employees name, surname, number or update all

### NOTICE

At the end of each operation, Update, Add or delete, I want you to show the main menu again!
